This is a Socket IO game that uses a model and a game controller on the backend, and React on the front end.
The dependencies in this project are express, http, socketIo, and cors.

This is a fullstack project using nodeJS and React. I was thinking about hooking it to a db and having a register/login authentication process but didn't get to that yet.
